# Yoda Me Astrology

## Description:

Yoda-Me-Astrology was developed for the purpose of entertainment. What better way to read your daily horoscope than from the Grand-Master Jedi himself? When the user clicks on their astrological sign, a pop up window will deploy with generated text processed by the yoda translator, giving you a unique horoscope that you can check daily!

Our focus was to offer a fun way to get your daily horoscope that would be quick, simple and user friendly. We especially wanted to reach a broad audience and be age inclusive and accessible. We thought Yoda was a character that was easily identifiable, and would bring a large user base.
